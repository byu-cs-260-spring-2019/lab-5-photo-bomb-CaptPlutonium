# Part 4: Authentication  -- Back End

Users need to register for an account and login.   Since we will be using Firebase for the back end, we do not need to write any back end code to store users, usernames, or passwords.

We will need to set a few things up to work with firebase authentication.  

Go to the firebase console (to the firebase project you have chosen for this lab).  Click on the Authentication tab, then click "Set up Sign in method".  Click the edit (pencil) icon for "Email/password".  Enable the top option "Allow users to sign up using their email address and password. Our SDKs also provide email address verification, password recovery, and email address change primitives."  Click "Save".
