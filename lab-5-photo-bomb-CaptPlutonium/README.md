# Lab 5: Authentication

In this assignment, you will build an entire web application, using Vue CLI for
the front end and Node, Express, and Firebase Firestore on the back end - including incorporating user authentication.

## Starting the Lab

To start the lab, you must follow this [GitHub Classroom link](https://classroom.github.com/a/kNOE8RZ2). This will create a private repository for you using our classroom site. We will only grade repositories created and submitted this way.

Once you "Accept the assignment" on GitHub Classroom, it will create a new repository for you and grant you access to it on GitHub. In order to start working on the lab, simply clone the repository to your laptop or other working environment.

## Tutorial

Use the [tutorials](/tutorials/README.md) to create the application. This will help you create an application for creating a user account, logging in, and displaying the logged in users email

## Additional Parts

Since we will not be doing Creative Project 5 - add something creative here.  At the minimum, create your own backend API by adding, editing, or removing something from your Firestore database.  Hint - you can store the user's email in your database if you'd like to store information about that person.

## Link to GitHub repository

In a footer, you must include a link to your GitHub repository, which must be stored in GitHub Classroom.

## Submission

On Canvas, submit the URL for your website, which should be running on your DigitalOcean server.

## Rubric for Grading

When we grade these labs, we will award points using the following
rubric:

| Item                                                                                         | Points |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |

| Additional Creative Portion (creating an API that hits the Firestore)                        | 30     |
